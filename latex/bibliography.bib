Most institutions lack the expertise required to research evolving threats and maintain a tough security posture.

Con questo regolamento, la Commissione europea si propone come obiettivo quello di rafforzare la protezione dei dati personali di cittadini dell'Unione europea ({UE}) e dei residenti nell'{UE}, sia all'interno che all'esterno dei confini dell'{UE}, restituendo ai cittadini il controllo dei propri dati personali, semplificando il contesto normativo che riguarda gli affari internazionali, unificando e rendendo omogenea la normativa privacy dentro l'{UE}.Il testo affronta anche il tema dell'esportazione di dati personali al di fuori dell'{UE} e obbliga tutti i titolari del trattamento dei dati (anche con sede legale fuori dall'{UE}) che trattano dati di residenti nell'{UE} ad osservare e adempiere agli obblighi previsti. Dalla sua entrata in vigore, il {GDPR} ha sostituito i contenuti della direttiva sulla protezione dei dati (Direttiva 95/46/{CE}) e, in Italia, ha abrogato gli articoli del codice per la protezione dei dati personali (d.lgs. n. 196/2003) con esso incompatibili.},
